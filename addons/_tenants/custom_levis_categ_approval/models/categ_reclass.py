"""Put Finance in front of a product-category reclassification.

``levis.categ.reclass`` already knows how to move a product to another category
and book the correction. What it did not have was a gate: whoever could open the
screen could change the ledger. This adds one, reusing ``custom_approval_engine``
rather than inventing a second workflow.

Pressing *Change Category & Book Correction* now stops at the gate: an
``approval.request`` is raised against the configured matrix (Accounting Manager,
then Finance Manager) and the record parks in **Waiting Approval**. Nothing is
written — not the category, not a single journal line. When the last tier
approves, the engine calls ``_approval_on_granted`` as the original requester and
the same action runs for real.
