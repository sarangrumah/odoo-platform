"""Keep the MDM feed from tripping over the category guard — or slipping past it.

The nightly master-data push writes ``categ_id`` onto templates that already
exist (``custom_retail_import/models/product_template.py``,
``_mdm_template_vals`` → ``_mdm_apply_extended``). Two bad outcomes to avoid:

* the guard raises inside a cron and the whole MDM batch dies;
* the feed is exempted and quietly re-categorises a product that has been sold,
  which is exactly what this module exists to prevent.

So the category is stripped out of the MDM write and a **draft**
``levis.categ.reclass`` is raised instead. The rest of the payload (cost, HS
code, dimensions, …) applies as usual, and the category change becomes a
reviewable request carrying its own correction figures.

The X101/X24 lazy-create paths are untouched — they ``create`` products rather
than ``write`` to them, so no existing balance is at stake.
