"""Make the pending-approval notification actually arrive.

``approval.request._notify_pending`` mails
``custom_approval_engine.mail_template_approval_pending`` — a template that was
never defined (the engine's ``data/mail_template_data.xml`` is a placeholder), so
it returns early and nobody is told anything. Rather than fix the engine for
every consumer at once, this schedules an Odoo activity per pending approver for
category reclassifications only: the bell lights up immediately, no outgoing mail
server required, and the to-do sits in the approver's list until they act.
