Levi's Product Category Change Approval
=======================================

At Levi's a ``product.category`` is an account mapping, not a label: it decides
which ``Gross Sales-<x>``, ``Sales Discount-<x>``, ``Sales Return-<x>``, COGS and
inventory account a product posts to. Changing it on a product that already has
transactions silently misstates the ledger — and nothing already posted follows
the change, because the POS closing entries carry no ``product_id`` at all.

``custom_levis_localization`` already ships **Product Category Reclassification**
(``levis.categ.reclass``), which recomputes the impact and books the correction.
This module makes going through it mandatory, and puts Finance in the loop:

* **Guard** — ``product.template.write`` refuses to change ``categ_id`` on a
  product that has movement *when the change actually moves the GL*. Re-parenting
  inside the same COA bucket (routine in the X101 tree) is untouched.
* **Approval** — ``levis.categ.reclass`` gains ``approval.mixin``. Applying a
  reclassification no longer changes anything directly; it raises a two-tier
  approval request (Accounting Manager, then Finance Manager) and leaves the
  record *Waiting Approval*. The category change and its correction entries are
  produced only once the last tier approves.
* **Notification** — every pending approver gets an Odoo activity naming the
  product, the accounts involved and the amount, and the requester gets a
  pop-up. The approval engine's own mail path is inert (its template was never
  defined), so the activity is what actually reaches people.
* **Imports stay alive** — an MDM feed that would re-categorise an existing
  product no longer aborts the batch, nor does it slip through: the category is
  left as it was and a draft reclassification is raised for review instead.
