"""Operating-Unit stamping on the POS session closing entry (feature #9).

A POS session belongs to exactly one store (``config_id.warehouse_id``), so every
line of its closing entry belongs to that store's Operating Unit. Core builds
those lines without any analytic distribution, which left the whole POS stream
outside the per-OU reporting.

Every line core produces is stamped: the sale lines (Gross Sales), the tax lines
(VAT Out) and the receivable lines (per-tender receivable, or the POS Suspense
Clearing account in the retail-import decouple flow). Finance reads the OU
dimension off the whole entry, not just its P&L half, so a VAT or suspense line
without a distribution shows up as an unallocated hole when the entry is sliced
per store.

The distribution is merged through the same helper the purchase side uses, so the
OU is appended to its own analytic plan rather than replacing any distribution
core may have derived from the product.
