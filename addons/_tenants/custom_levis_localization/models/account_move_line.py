"""Payable-account routing for the Trade / Non-Trade split (feature #9).

The vendor bill's payable (payment-term) line account is computed by core
``account.move.line._compute_account_id``. For Levi's, the payable must follow
the purchase stream carried on the bill (``account.move.l10n_purchase_type``):
Trade Payables vs Non-Trade payable. The accounts come from the per-company
``levis.purchase.account.map`` so no hard ids leak into code.

The stream alone does not decide the account: the EBR chart splits AP again by
counterparty, third party vs **related party** (in-group companies such as PT
Sinar Eka Selaras). Vendors flagged ``l10n_related_party`` take the mapping's
related-party account; before that flag existed every Erajaya-group bill landed
on the third-party control account no matter what the vendor master said.
