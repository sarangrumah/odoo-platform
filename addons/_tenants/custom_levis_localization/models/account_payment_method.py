"""Extra manual payment methods for Levi's (feedback Finance-AP #7).

The bank-out / bank-in flows need CHECK, GIRO and BANK TRANSFER as selectable
payment methods. CHECK already ships as ``check_printing``; GIRO and BANK
TRANSFER are registered here as manual-style methods (``mode='multi'`` so they
can be added to any bank journal). The ``account.payment.method`` records
themselves are created in ``data/payment_methods.xml``; a method's ``code`` must
be known to this dict at create time, hence the override.
