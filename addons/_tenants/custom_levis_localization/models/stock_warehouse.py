"""Operating-Unit wiring on the warehouse (store).

Each Levi's store is a ``stock.warehouse``. Feature #9 turns the store into a
posted **Operating Unit** dimension: every store owns

* an ``account.analytic.account`` (in the "Operating Unit" analytic plan) that is
  stamped on PO / bill / GR-journal lines so journals and P&L can be sliced per
  store, and
* a dedicated **purchase journal** so vendor bills are separated per store.

The links are populated idempotently by the module seeding (post-init hook /
``40_setup_trade_ou.py``); the fields here just hold them.
