"""Admin fees on payment registration.

Lets a bill/invoice payment carry one or more *admin fee* lines -- each booked
to its own COA -- on top of the amount that settles the bill.

Example: a 1,000,000 vendor bill with a 1,500 bank admin fee produces a
1,001,500 cash-out whose journal entry debits Accounts Payable 1,000,000,
debits the fee account 1,500 and credits the bank 1,001,500::

    Dr  Accounts Payable (counterpart)   1,000,000   -> reconciles the bill
    Dr  Bank Admin Charges (fee COA)         1,500   -> one line per fee COA
    Cr  Bank (liquidity)                             1,001,500

The fees ride Odoo's native payment *write-off* channel, so the counterpart
(``amount - fees``) still equals the bill residual and the bill reconciles in
full. As a bonus the fee lines are ordinary journal items, so they surface on
the Payment Voucher / Receipt without any extra work.
