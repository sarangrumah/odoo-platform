"""Trade / Non-Trade account mapping.

Feature #9 splits every purchase into a **trade** stream (merchandise for
resale) and a **non-trade** stream (operational / opex). The two streams post
to different accounts:

* the **payable** account on the vendor bill (Trade Payables vs Non-Trade
  payable), and
* the **GR/IR clearing** (stock-variation) account used by the platform-way GR
  valuation journal for storable lines.

Because account *codes* are company-dependent in Odoo 19 and the numeric ids
differ per database, the mapping is a data table keyed by ``(company,
purchase_type)`` rather than hard xml-ids. Rows are seeded idempotently by code
lookup (see ``custom_levis_localization`` post-init hook / setup script) and can
be adjusted from Accounting ▸ Configuration ▸ Trade/Non-Trade Accounts.
