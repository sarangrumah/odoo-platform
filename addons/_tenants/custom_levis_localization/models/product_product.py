        # registry.check_foreign_keys() then re-creates any missing core foreign
        # key -- including product_value_product_id_fkey, which prd_levis_begbal
        # and rnd_levis have lost. On those two the ALTER TABLE fails against the
        # rows whose product_id no longer resolves, and the upgrade rolls back.

        #    delete when an X101 re-import rebuilds the Size x Inseam matrix.
        #  - last_value matches product.product._compute_value ->
        #    _get_last_product_value: filters move_id IS NULL AND company_id = %s
        #    AND lot_id IS NULL, then DISTINCT ON (product_id)
        #    ORDER BY product_id, date DESC, id DESC.
