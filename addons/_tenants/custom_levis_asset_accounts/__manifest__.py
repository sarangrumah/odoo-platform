Levi's Fixed Asset Revaluation Accounts
=======================================
Seeds the 6 EBR fixed-asset categories (Land, Building & improvements, Vehicles,
Office & outlet equipment, Machinery, Furniture & fixtures) as
``custom.fixed.asset.group`` records — each wired to its Erajaya cost /
accumulated-depreciation / depreciation-expense account by code per company — and
fills the IAS 16 revaluation account defaults on every ``custom.fixed.asset.group``
(``default_revaluation_surplus_account_id`` / ``_loss_`` / ``_income_`` /
``default_retained_earnings_account_id``) for companies running the Erajaya chart.

Accounts are resolved **by code within each company** (not by XML id, which is
company-prefixed after the chart loads), so the wiring is correct across every
tenant company and survives upgrades. The setup is:

* **idempotent** — re-run on every ``-u``; only empty fields are filled, so manual
  overrides and previous runs are preserved;
* **self-scoping** — a company without the Erajaya codes (e.g. an id_psak company)
  is skipped automatically;
* **bootstrapping** — if a company has no asset group yet, a default "General"
  group is created so the revaluation defaults have somewhere to live.
