ARKA-AIM Document Numbering
===========================
Applies the tenant's document-number format from the master-data "Document #"
sheet to the two companies in the arkaaim tenant (PT ARKA, PT AIM):

  Sales Quotation   SQ/<CO>/YYYY/MM/NNN   (sale.order while draft/sent)
  Sales Order       SO/<CO>/YYYY/MM/NNN   (sale.order, re-numbered on confirm)
  Purchase Order    PO/<CO>/YYYY/MM/NNN   (purchase.order)
  Invoice           INV/<CO>/YYYY/MM/NNN  (account.move, customer invoice)
  Delivery Order    DO/AIM/YYYY/MM/NNN    (stock.picking, outgoing, AIM only)
  BAST              BAST/<CO>/YYYY/MM/NNN (custom.bast.document)

<CO> is the company short code (ARKA / AIM) held on ``res.company.x_doc_code``.
NNN is a 3-digit running number that RESETS every month.

Mechanism
---------
* Per-company ``ir.sequence`` records (``company_id`` set) so each company gets
  its own prefix; ``next_by_code`` automatically picks the active company's one.
* Monthly reset via ``use_date_range`` + a scoped ``ir.sequence`` override that
  creates MONTHLY date ranges (stock Odoo only creates yearly ranges).
* Quotation -> Sales Order re-numbering on confirm; the original SQ number is
  kept on ``sale.order.x_quotation_name`` for audit.
* Customer invoices use a monthly ``_get_starting_sequence`` (gated to companies
  that have ``x_doc_code`` set), so other tenants/companies are untouched.

TENANT-SCOPED: install only on the arkaaim tenant DBs (e.g. prd_arkaaim,
trn_arkaaim). Behaviour is gated by ``res.company.x_doc_code`` so the module is
inert for any company without a code.
