"""Serial-tracking extension of ``custom.fixed.asset``.

The base model has no serial or source-listing fields (one record = one asset).
The AIM drone register is loaded per unit/serial, so we add a small set of
identity fields to hold the physical listing's serial number, asset group and
description. These are informational only -- they do not affect depreciation.
