"""Foreign-currency context inside the "Register Payment" popup.

The bank journals of the ARKA-AIM books are locked to the company currency
(IDR), so paying a CNY bill opens a wizard whose ``Amount`` is already the
*converted* IDR figure - Odoo's ``_convert_to_wizard_currency`` turns the CNY
residual into IDR at the payment date. Nothing about that number is raw.

The problem is that the popup never says so. All the user sees is an IDR
amount, with no trace of the CNY residual it settles nor of the rate that was
applied, so there is no way to tell a correct conversion from a missing one.
This adds that context, plus a loud warning for the one case where the amount
really would be raw: no ``res.currency.rate`` row for the document currency, in
which case ``_convert`` silently falls back to 1:1 and a CN¥ 20,000 bill would
propose "Rp 20.000".

Display only - no amount, rate or posting behaviour is changed.
