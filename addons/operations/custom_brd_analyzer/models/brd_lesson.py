"""Lessons learned — analyst corrections persisted as injectable hints.

When an analyst rejects a wrong recommendation (e.g. "custom_drone_rental was
proposed but custom_rental already covers it"), the correction is saved as a
``brd.lesson`` record. The analyzer reads active lessons at each run and
injects relevant ones into the system prompt so the LLM doesn't repeat the
same mistake.

Two severities:
* ``blocker`` — always injected (e.g. "never propose modules whose name
  starts with custom_drone_; covered by custom_rental").
* ``hint`` — injected only when keywords from the lesson's section_pattern
  overlap with the current BRD's content. Cheap substring match keeps
  irrelevant lessons out of the prompt.
