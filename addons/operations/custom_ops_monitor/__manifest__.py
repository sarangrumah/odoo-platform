Custom Ops Monitor
==================

Pulls live tenant metrics from Prometheus, capacity projections from the
``custom-predictor`` service, and Alertmanager webhooks into Odoo so the
ops team has a single pane of glass:

- **Health Dashboard** — OWL component, heatmap tile per tenant, drill
  to per-tenant time-series + embedded Grafana iframe.
- **Tenant Health History** — every 60s a snapshot is upserted per
  tenant: CPU, memory, disk, request rate, error rate, DB size, Redis
  hit rate, backup freshness.
- **Capacity Forecast** — every hour the predictor service is asked for
  30/90/365-day projections per metric, with severity automatically
  computed against capacity thresholds.
- **Incidents** — ``POST /api/ops/alert`` accepts Alertmanager webhook
  v4 payloads, upserts ``custom.ops.incident`` rows, opens an Odoo
  mail.activity assigned to the on-call ops user.
