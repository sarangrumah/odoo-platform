Custom PPOB Suite - Commission
==============================
Two-way commissions:

* provider_to_us: rebate earned from the provider. Accrued to Commission
  Receivable on each success transaction; settled against a provider vendor
  refund at period close.
* us_to_mitra: rebate paid to mitra. Accrued to Mitra Rebate Expense +
  Commission Payable; settled with PPh 23 withholding resolved through
  ``custom.witholding.engine`` (custom_pph_witholding) -- 2% with NPWP / 4%
  without, per the platform's rate matrix.

On each successful transaction, matching rules create ``custom.ppob.commission.accrual``
rows; the settlement wizard closes a period into vendor refunds or mitra payouts.
