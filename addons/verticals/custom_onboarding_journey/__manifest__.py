Custom Onboarding Journey
=========================

Coordinates the entire tenant onboarding lifecycle as a single state machine
(``onboarding.journey``). Each stage transition is appended to an immutable
audit log (``onboarding.stage.transition``).

Bi-directional sync with ``project.project``: each journey owns a project
seeded from a template; stage changes propagate to kanban columns, and
movements of "stage marker" tasks back-propagate to the journey stage. Loop
prevention is handled via a ``_skip_journey_sync`` context flag, and
conflicts use last-write-wins on a per-record ``sync_version`` counter.

A public intake controller (``/onboarding/public/intake``) lets prospects
submit company profile + wishlist via the marketing site, optionally guarded
by Cloudflare Turnstile and a per-IP rate limit.
