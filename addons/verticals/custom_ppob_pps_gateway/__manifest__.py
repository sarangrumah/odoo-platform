Custom PPOB Suite - PPS Gateway (Revamp II: Odoo as switcher)
============================================================
Revamp II makes Odoo REPLACE the vendor PPS/EVShop switcher. ERASPACE POS keeps
its existing integration and simply re-points its base URL to Odoo: this module
exposes the SAME PPS H2H API surface as a drop-in and maps every request onto
the native ``custom.ppob.transaction`` engine + wallet ("deposit") + provider
adapter registry. Odoo fulfils to real billers itself (its own adapters); the
vendor PPS is NOT called downstream.

Endpoints (mimicking the PPS contract, MD5-signed per the vendor spec):
  * POST /pps/sell                  -> create + dispatch a transaction (RC 9/0/1)
  * POST /pps/statustrx             -> latest status of a Sell
  * POST /pps/statustrxwithdeposit  -> + the mitra deposit (wallet balance)
  * POST /pps/checknocustomer       -> e-wallet name inquiry (adapter.inquiry)
  * POST /pps/inquiry-pln (JSON)    -> PLN inquiry (meter/name/tariff)
  * POST /pps/game-list   (JSON)    -> catalog of game products + dynamic fields
  * POST /pps/direct-topup(JSON)    -> game top-up with dynamic field payload
Async: Sell returns pending, the engine drives to terminal, and a cron fires the
GET Callback to the POS callback URL within the SLA; StatusTrx is the fallback.

Security note: the PPS contract mandates **MD5** signatures (per-endpoint
formulas). MD5 is cryptographically weak; it is confined to
``controllers/pps_signature.py`` and compensated by IP allowlist + replay guard
+ timestamp/notrx freshness. The platform HMAC-SHA256 convention is NOT diluted
-- nothing outside this module imports ``pps_signature``.

Real biller integration is a separate concern: each biller is a
``@register_adapter`` subclass wired to a ``custom.ppob.provider``. This gateway
never references a concrete biller -- it only calls ``provider._get_adapter()``
-- so it is fully testable against the existing ``ppob_mock`` adapter.
