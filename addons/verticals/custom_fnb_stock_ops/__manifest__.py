Custom F&B Stock Ops
====================

The three capabilities the EFN (Erajaya F&B) vertical needs on top of ESB Core,
built on ``custom_esb_connector``. ESB stays the source of truth for stock: Odoo
runs the intelligence and pushes the outcome back as native ESB documents.

**Stock Opname.** Counting reuses ``custom_wms_cycle_count`` rather than
reimplementing it — the plan/session/line model, the counting UX and the
supervisor variance gate are already there. This module adds the ESB half:
sessions are scoped to an ESB branch + location, expected quantities are seeded
from ``custom.esb.stock.snapshot`` instead of ``stock.quant``, and closing a
session emits **one ESB Item Journal** carrying the signed variance per line.
No Odoo ``stock.move`` is created for an ESB-backed session — that would be a
phantom movement against stock Odoo does not own.

**Demand Forecasting.** Daily material consumption is pulled from the ESB OMS
``get-daily-sales-material-usage`` feed, which is already exploded through the
BOM. Forecasting uses transparent, explainable baselines — moving average,
weighted moving average and day-of-week seasonal naive (F&B demand is strongly
day-of-week driven). No ML dependency: the method is a Selection, so a heavier
model can be swapped in later without changing the consumers.

**Auto Replenishment.** Per-branch rules compute
``forecast x (lead time + review period) + safety stock - on hand - on order``
and raise **draft proposals in Odoo**. Nothing reaches ESB until a user approves;
on approval the proposal becomes an ESB Purchase Request, Goods Transfer Request
or Purchase Order, pushed through the connector's idempotent outbox.

Every cron ships disabled and every push is gated behind ``esb.push_enabled``.
