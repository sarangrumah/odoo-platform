Custom PPh Witholding Engine
============================

Extracts the PPh23 witholding logic that was previously embedded in
``era_ppob_commission`` and generalises it into a reusable service.

Models
------
* ``custom.witholding.rate`` — rate matrix keyed by PPh type, service
  category, and validity window. Distinguishes with-NPWP vs without-NPWP
  (Indonesian NPWP = 15 or 16 digit numeric).
* ``custom.witholding.engine`` — abstract service exposing
  ``compute(partner, amount, pph_type, date)``.
* ``custom.witholding.application`` — append-only log of every
  computed/applied withholding event.

Triggers
--------
* Manual wizard "Apply Witholding" on any ``account.move``.
* Lazy hooks on ``hr.payslip`` and ``account.payment`` (gated by
  module-installed check — no hard dependency on payroll).
