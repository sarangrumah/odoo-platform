"""Heal pdp.audit_log.action constraint on already-provisioned tenants.

Early DBs were created from 02-pdp-schema.sql when the ``action`` column was
VARCHAR(16) with an enumerated CHECK. Feature modules log domain verbs such as
``approval_submit`` / ``approval_advance`` that the enum rejected (and some are
longer than 16 chars), which aborted the surrounding business transaction
(e.g. ARKA Sales Order approval submit).

This migration widens the column and replaces the enum CHECK with the same
snake_case format check shipped in the current schema. The ``action`` column is
referenced by the read-only view ``pdp.audit_log_v``, so the view is captured,
dropped, and faithfully recreated around the ALTER. Idempotent and safe to
re-run; no-op when the pdp schema is absent.
