Custom Accounting Full
======================

Closes the multi-company gap between Odoo CE's base ``account`` module
and the EE ``account_consolidation`` + ``account_inter_company_rules``
modules. Scoped to what an Indonesian SMB-mid group needs:

Features
--------
- **Indonesian Chart of Accounts (PSAK-aligned)** — minimum-viable
  set of ~70 accounts covering Aset / Kewajiban / Ekuitas / Pendapatan
  / HPP / Beban / Pajak. Installable from ``data/account_chart_id.xml``.
- **Intercompany automation** — rule table maps a partner (linked to
  ``res.company.partner_id`` of another company) to an auto-mirror
  policy. When Company A posts a sales invoice to a partner that
  represents Company B's commercial entity, Company B automatically
  receives a draft vendor bill mirroring the same lines, with mapped
  accounts and the inter-company journal.
- **Consolidation engine** — declare a parent + N subsidiaries +
  elimination accounts. Wizards produce consolidated Trial Balance,
  P&L, and Balance Sheet across all subsidiaries with a dedicated
  "Eliminations" column.
- **Branch dimension** — ``account.analytic.account`` extended with
  ``branch_code`` + ``is_branch_root`` for cost-centre reporting by
  legal branch / kantor cabang.

The reports honour the active Odoo user's allowed_company_ids — a
consolidator user must have access to *all* subsidiaries for figures
to be complete; otherwise the report renders only the visible slice
and flags the gap in its header.

Audit
-----
Every consolidation report run, intercompany mirror creation, and
elimination journal entry is written to ``pdp.audit_log`` via the
``pdp.audited.mixin`` chain.
