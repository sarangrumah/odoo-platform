VAS PMO - Change Requests
=========================
A change request is **not** a task with a different label, so it is not modelled as one.

Three things a task does not have, and which would otherwise sit empty on every task in
the system:

1. **A tiered approval gate.** BA -> Product Owner -> vertical owner (the third tier only
   for high / critical impact), each decision recorded with who and when.
2. **Impact analysis.** Affected modules, risk, effort, downtime need, rollback plan.
3. **Its own response SLA**, counted from the moment the brand asked -- not from the
   moment someone started working -- plus an official ``CR-YYYY-NNNN`` number the brand
   quotes back at us.

What *is* shared with tasks: the stage set and its SLA-clock semantics
(``project.task.type`` from ``custom_project_portfolio``) and the audit trail. Behaviour
that must feel identical is implemented once.

Intake
------
New requests land in a single triage queue (``approval_state = draft``) exactly like
Plane's Intake: one queue, one reviewer decision, then it either becomes analysed work or
is rejected with a reason.

Deviation from the plan
-----------------------
The plan said to drive approvals through ``custom_approval_engine``. This module keeps a
small native approval chain instead, so that a change request stays installable and
testable without pulling the whole approval stack into this tenant. The hook
``_cr_external_approval_hook`` is where that integration lands when it is wanted.
