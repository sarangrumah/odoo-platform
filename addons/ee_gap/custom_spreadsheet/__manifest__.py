    "description": """
Custom Spreadsheet (EE-equivalent Tier-3 layer) provides:

- Workbook + tag model with JSON-encoded grid storage
- Real CSV import wizard (parses csv into sheets/cells)
- Real CSV export (ir.attachment download)
- AI helpers: ask AI, formula suggestion, data cleaning report
- Load records from any Odoo model into a workbook sheet
- Version snapshots on every data change with restore
- Public share link (read-only HTML table render)
- PDP audit trail via pdp.audited.mixin

The interactive grid renderer remains delegated to Odoo 19's CE
`spreadsheet` engine; this module focuses on the workbook layer.
