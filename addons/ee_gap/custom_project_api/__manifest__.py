VAS PMO - REST API
==================
The read/write surface the headless UI runs on, shaped like ``custom_storefront_api`` so
that the two front-ends are operated the same way.

Auth
----
``auth.jwt.validator`` named ``vaspmo`` (HS256, ``aud=vaspmo``). The validator's
``user_id_strategy`` gains a ``vaspmo_login`` option: unlike the storefront -- where every
caller is a customer and maps to one static internal user -- here the caller *is* an
internal user, and every write has to be attributed to them in the audit trail. The token
therefore carries ``sub`` = login, and ``_get_uid`` resolves the real ``res.users``.

Refresh tokens are stored hashed in ``custom.vaspmo.token``; the access token lives 15
minutes. ``user_id`` in a request body is never trusted -- identity comes from the token.

Machine-to-machine
------------------
``/vaspmo/api/hmac/...`` uses the platform HMAC scheme already in use elsewhere:
``X-Signature = HMAC-SHA256(secret, ascii(X-Timestamp) + raw_body)``, five-minute replay
window, secret in ``ir.config_parameter custom_core.secure_endpoint.vaspmo.secret``.
