    "summary": "Inbound quarantine: QC gate on receipts, non-reservable inbound stock, unknown-item registration",
    "description": """
Closes three inbound gaps that plain Odoo 19 CE leaves open:

* **Quarantine that actually quarantines.** Stock sitting in an inbound / QC
  area is excluded from outbound reservation at the ``stock.quant`` gather
  level, so a sales delivery can never promise goods that have not been
  inspected. Native Odoo would happily reserve them.
* **A QC gate on receipts.** Picking types can require inspection; the receipt
  lands in the QC area and only a pass releases the goods into pickable stock
  through an internal transfer that the putaway engine then slots.
* **Unknown-item registration.** A barcode scanned at goods receipt that
  matches no product is captured as a ``custom.wms.product.registration``
  record and turned into a real product after review, instead of blocking the
  receiving operator.
