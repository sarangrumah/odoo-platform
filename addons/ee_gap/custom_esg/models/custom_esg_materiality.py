"""Materiality assessment: stakeholder × business impact quadrant.

Used by sustainability teams to score each ESG topic on two axes and
plot it on a 2x2 matrix:

                Critical     |  Important
                (high SH,    | (high SH,
                 low biz)    |  high biz)
                -------------+-------------
                Monitoring   |  Minor
                (low SH,     | (low SH,
                 low biz)    |  high biz)

(POJK 51 §3 lists materiality as a mandatory disclosure axis.)
