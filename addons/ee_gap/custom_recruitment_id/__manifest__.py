    "description": """
Custom Recruitment ID extends Odoo CE hr_recruitment with Indonesia-specific
capabilities and EE-equivalent recruitment features required by the
multi-tenant platform:

- Job-board source tracking (Jobstreet, Glints, LinkedIn, Kalibrr, Direct)
- Webhook intake (HMAC-SHA256 verified) endpoint for Jobstreet / Glints /
  LinkedIn payloads.
- Candidate dedup via SHA1(lower(email) + normalize(phone)) hash with
  duplicate-of pointer.
- One-click interview scheduling helper that opens a pre-filled
  calendar.event for the applicant + job interviewers.
- Indonesia Offer Letter PDF report (jabatan, gaji, estimasi PPh 21,
  masa percobaan, mulai kerja).
- PDP-aware applicant retention: cron anonymizes expired applicants
  (REDACTED-<id>) while preserving stage history + writing a pdp.audit_log
  trail.
- Job posting auto-publish stub for Jobstreet / Glints with external
  post-id tracking.
