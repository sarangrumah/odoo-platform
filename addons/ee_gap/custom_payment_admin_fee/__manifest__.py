Payment Admin Fees
==================
The Register Payment wizard gains an *Admin Fees* section where one or more fee
lines (each with its own COA, label and amount) can be added on top of the
bill/invoice being settled.

A 1,000,000 vendor bill with a 1,500 bank admin fee produces a 1,001,500
cash-out::

    Dr  Accounts Payable (counterpart)   1,000,000   -> reconciles the bill
    Dr  Bank Admin Charges (fee COA)         1,500   -> one line per fee COA
    Cr  Bank (liquidity)                             1,001,500

The fees ride Odoo's native payment *write-off* channel, so the counterpart
(``amount - fees``) still equals the bill residual and the bill reconciles in
full. The fee lines are ordinary journal items, so they also show up on any
payment voucher/receipt printout.

A negative amount is allowed: the fee is then netted *off* the settlement
(cash-in lower than the receivable), which is how acquirer/transfer charges on
customer receipts are usually booked.

NOTE: this is the tenant-neutral extraction of the same feature in
``custom_levis_localization`` (which adds card-BIN/MDR and Operating-Unit
handling on top). Do NOT install both on the same database -- the Admin Fees
section would appear twice.
