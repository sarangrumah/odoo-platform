    "description": """
Custom Expenses extends the standard ``hr_expense`` application with:

- AI-assisted receipt OCR extraction (amount, date, vendor, tax_amount,
  currency_code, confidence) delivered via ``custom_ai_bridge``
  (``custom.ai._recommend``) sending the receipt attachment as base64.
- Generic approval workflow plug-in via ``custom_approval_engine``'s
  ``approval.mixin`` (replacing the standard manager-only submit chain).
- ``custom.expense.report`` — bulk submit / approve / register payment for
  a batch of expenses sharing the same employee.
- ``custom.expense.corporate.card`` — masked card number + bank journal
  linkage so expenses paid via corporate card auto-mark payment_mode as
  ``company_account`` and skip the reimbursement queue.
- Mileage tracking — per-km rate driven by ``ir.config_parameter``
  ``custom_expenses.id_mileage_rate`` (default 5000 IDR/km).
- Reimbursement payment flow — generate ``account.payment`` for own-account
  expenses approved through the matrix.
- PDP audit logging on submit / approve transitions through the
  ``custom_pdp_audit`` infrastructure.
