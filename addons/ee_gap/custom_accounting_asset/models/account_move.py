"""Keep fixed-asset depreciation lines in sync with their journal entries.

A depreciation line records ``posted`` + ``move_id`` when the schedule books its
entry. If an accountant later resets that entry to draft, cancels or deletes it
directly in Accounting (rather than via the asset's Reverse action), the line
must not stay ``posted`` — otherwise the accumulated depreciation / NBV are
overstated and the period can never be re-posted (feedback Accounting #4/#20).

These overrides self-heal the linked lines:
* entry set to draft / cancelled -> line un-posted (NBV recomputes);
* entry deleted                 -> line un-posted and detached, so the schedule
                                    can post it again.
