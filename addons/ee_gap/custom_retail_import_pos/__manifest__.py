Custom Retail Import — POS bridge
=================================

Auto-installed whenever both ``custom_retail_import`` and ``point_of_sale`` are
present. Kept separate because ``custom_retail_import`` deliberately does **not**
depend on ``point_of_sale`` — the ARKA-AIM tenant runs the importer without POS,
and a hard dependency would force-install the POS application there.

What it does
------------
* Adds ``ri_src_net`` / ``ri_src_tax`` / ``ri_src_discount`` / ``ri_is_return`` to
  ``pos.order.line``, populated by the X24DN and X48 importers from the source
  workbook's own columns.
* Overrides ``pos.order.line._prepare_base_line_for_taxes_computation`` so that
  POS session close books **exactly** those amounts:

  - The source file truncates net to whole rupiah per line
    (``net = trunc(total/1.11)``, ``tax = total - net``) while Odoo rounds tax
    globally per order. Feeding the file's figures through the tax engine's
    ``manual_tax_amounts`` hook removes the resulting per-line 1-rupiah drift.
  - Customer-return lines are re-pointed from ``Gross Sales-<category>`` to
    ``Sales Return-<category>`` so returns are reported on their own COA.
* Appends the source ``NET DISCOUNT AMOUNT`` reclass (Dr ``Sales Discount-<cat>`` /
  Cr ``Gross Sales-<cat>``) to the store's own POS closing entry while it is still
  draft, instead of posting a separate summary journal that no store could tie to.
* Keeps the source workbook's descriptive columns on the posted records: the
  cashier (``ri_staff_id`` / ``ri_staff_name``), the four discount slots folded
  into ``ri_discount_type`` / ``ri_discount_code`` / ``ri_discount_description``,
  and the transaction's member / notes / Omni order id on ``pos.order``.
