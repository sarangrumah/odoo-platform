    "description": """
Extended quality module: in addition to the baseline quality.point /
quality.check / quality.alert (NCR) skeleton, this version adds:

* Multi-line inspection lines per check (with min/max ranges and accepted
  value sets).
* Tamper-evident e-signatures on checks and CAPAs.
* Structured CAPA records linked to alerts (corrective / preventive /
  containment), with auto-resolve cascade.
* Reusable Quality Test templates that can be applied to a check or
  attached as a default to a quality.point.
