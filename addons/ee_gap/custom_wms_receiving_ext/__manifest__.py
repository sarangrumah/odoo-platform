WMS Receiving Extensions
========================
Closes the goods-receipt gaps of the WMS stack (client requirements 3 & 4)
without touching the shared ``custom_barcode`` addon:

- **GS1 expiry write-through** — AI 17 (expiration date) was parsed into the
  scan line's ``x_gs1_parsed`` JSON but never applied; it now lands on
  ``stock.lot.expiration_date`` when the scan is applied to the picking.
- **Supplier batch reference** — new field on ``stock.lot`` and on the scan
  line; filled manually or from the GS1 lot (AI 10) when applied.
- **Receipt template import** — wizard on incoming pickings to upload a
  CSV/XLSX template (barcode/SKU, serial or lot, qty, expiry date, supplier
  batch) that creates move lines + lots in bulk; includes a downloadable
  blank template.
