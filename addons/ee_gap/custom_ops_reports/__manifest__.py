Custom Operational Reports
==========================
Five operational reports for the AIM Inventory / warehouse team, built on the
shared ``custom.report.engine`` so each one renders as an on-screen table and an
Excel export from a single column/line contract (no PDF — these are working
lists, not signed documents):

* **Asset Opname** (#15) — the drone fleet register with accounting state,
  best-effort operational state (rental) and condition (latest BAST).
* **Event Movement** (#16) — in/out unit & tool movement per rental event.
* **Spare Parts** (#17) — spare availability (stock) + usage from maintenance.
* **Maintenance Health** (#18) — per-equipment request counts, MTBF/MTTR, cost.
* **Repair History** (#19) — repair.order history with SLA, rework and cost.

Depends on the operational apps that own the data, so it only installs where the
fleet is actually operated in Odoo.

    # Generic modules only. Depending on a tenant module (e.g.
    # custom_arka_aim_asset_register) would invert the layering and drag that
    # tenant's data seed into any database that just wanted the reports.
    # `serial_number` is contributed by the ARKA register and is read
    # defensively, so these reports install and run without it.
