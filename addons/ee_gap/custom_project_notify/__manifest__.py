VAS PMO - Notifications
=======================
Why the event is born in Odoo, not in the BFF
---------------------------------------------
e-Telekomunikasi puts its notification calls straight in the Next.js route handlers,
which works there because Next.js is the only writer. Here there are four: the VAS PMO
UI, the Odoo backend, the Jira webhook, and the ticket bridge. Wiring notifications into
the BFF alone would leave three of those four silent.

So ``project.task`` / ``custom.change.request`` / ``project.project`` /
``custom.weekly.progress`` write a row into ``custom.project.notify.outbox`` on every
tracked event, whatever the origin. A cron drains the outbox to the BFF over HMAC, and
the BFF renders and sends -- so the actual WhatsApp / e-mail code stays a single
TypeScript file that mirrors ``notification-service.ts``, while the coverage is complete.

Rules are data
--------------
``custom.project.notify.rule`` maps event -> recipient kinds -> channels. The PO Lead can
change who hears about what without a deploy. That is a direct lift of e-Telekomunikasi's
``DOC_NEXT_REVIEWER`` map, promoted from a Python constant to a table.

Three logs, deliberately not merged
-----------------------------------
* ``pdp.audit.log`` answers "who changed what".
* ``custom.project.notify.log`` (here) answers "was the human actually told".
* ``adapter.call.log`` answers "did the outside world respond".
