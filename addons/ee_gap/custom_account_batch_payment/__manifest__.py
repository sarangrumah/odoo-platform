Custom Batch Payments
=====================

Closes the EE-gap on Odoo CE ``account_batch_payment``:

* Group posted ``account.payment`` records of one bank journal into a
  batch (draft → validated → sent → reconciled).
* Export a bank transfer file per batch. Formats are pluggable records
  (``custom.batch.payment.format``) mirroring the
  ``custom.bank.import.template`` pattern — seeded with BCA MCM,
  Mandiri MCM, BNI and BRI CSV layouts, refine against the corporate
  H2H contract's real sample files before freezing.
* Smart button + "Add to Batch" action on payments; batch turns
  *reconciled* once every payment is paid & matched with a statement.
