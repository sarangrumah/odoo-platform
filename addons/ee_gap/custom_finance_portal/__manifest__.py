Custom Finance Portal
=====================

Odoo as a **system of engagement** in front of SAP S/4HANA (system of record).
Odoo runs the submission forms, the two-stage **Tax Review -> Finance Review**
approval, and budget/PR validation; the approved document is later pushed to SAP
(by ``custom_finance_portal_sap``) which posts the GL / MIRO and pays. Odoo never
posts its own journal entries — it only mirrors SAP status back.

Document types (all use ``approval.mixin`` + ``pdp.audited.mixin``):

- ``finance.cash.advance`` + ``finance.cash.advance.realization``
- ``finance.reimbursement`` (Reimbursement & Expenses)
- ``finance.vendor.invoice`` (PO Non-Trade / Non-PO Non-Trade) + vendor portal
- ``finance.travel.settlement`` (read-only mirror of HRIS travel, settled vs CA)

Light master data: submission type, invoice type/routine, item of submission,
vertical (division), limitation for submission (incl. the PR-required threshold).

The SAP push and status mirror are *hooks* (``_finance_push_to_sap`` /
``_finance_apply_sap_status``) overridden by ``custom_finance_portal_sap``; out of
the box they run in a local stub so the engagement layer is usable standalone.

Part of the Custom Platform — multi-tenant Odoo 19 for Indonesian SMB.
