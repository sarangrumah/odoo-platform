"""Bring existing databases in line with the 19.0.0.12.0 data files.

``data/retail_import_profiles.xml`` is ``noupdate="1"``, so widening the X24DN column
map only affects fresh installs. Existing tenants get it here.

Without this, ``_post_x24`` never sees the cashier, the four discount slots or the
member/notes columns, and the posted pos.order carries none of them.
