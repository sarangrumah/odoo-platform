"""Move the custom_retail_import groups onto the module's own privilege.

Groups that share a res.groups.privilege are rendered as ONE pick-one dropdown
on the user form, so saving a user kept a single custom group and silently
dropped every other module's group -- that is what emptied
custom_accounting_reports.group_report_user on prd_levis_begbal and made the
Accounting Reports menu disappear for all 72 users.

The group records carry noupdate="1", so the new privilege_id in the XML is
never applied to tenants where the groups already exist; this re-points them.
Only groups still sitting on the shared privilege (or on none) are touched, so
a deliberate manual re-assignment survives. Idempotent.
