Custom Retail Import
====================

Productized adapter that converts customer-provided Excel/CSV files into Odoo
records, plus an optional direct-from-SFTP recurring feed. Built for the Levi's
(PT Sinar Eka Selaras) onboarding and reusable for any retail tenant.

Generalizes the ``custom_bank_import`` template/wizard/log trio into per-file-type
**import profiles** (X101 products, X20 on-hand, X24 POS sales, X70 tenders, CoA,
company, store master), and ports the proven era_busana_retailindo X101 pipeline
into the X101 executor.

Pieces
------
* ``retail.import.profile`` — declares how to parse one file type (xlsx/csv,
  ``data_start_row`` for report-style files with a title row, a JSON column map,
  date/decimal parsing, U+FFFD→® cleanup).
* ``retail.import.wizard`` — Binary upload with a **dry-run preview**; SHA256
  file-hash dedup; large files (X101) run async via ``queue_job`` to dodge the
  reverse-proxy timeout.
* ``retail.import.executor`` — per-file-type loaders with ``ir.model.data``
  external IDs for idempotency. X101/CoA/company/X20 are full; X24/X70 are
  Phase-5 decision-gated; X70T/X31/X32P/store-master are staged.
* ``retail.import.log`` — audit trail, keeps the source file in ir.attachment.
* ``retail.import.feed`` — SFTP poller (paramiko) that pulls new files into the
  same executor on an ``ir.cron`` schedule.
* ``retail.import.mailbox`` — IMAP bridge for tenants whose source files arrive as
  nightly email attachments. Backs every attachment up to the SFTP share, drops the
  ingestible ones into a feed's directory, then deletes the message once the backup
  verifies. Deletion keys off the backup, never the import, so a parser bug can never
  destroy source data.
