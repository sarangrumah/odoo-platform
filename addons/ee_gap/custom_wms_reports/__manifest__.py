WMS Reporting Pack
==================
Closes the reporting gaps of the WMS stack (client requirements 11-15):

- **Purchase Return Report** — done moves to supplier locations, grouped
  per supplier / per SKU (list + pivot).
- **Stock Summary Report** — on-hand per SKU / warehouse / location with
  unit cost and stock value (list + pivot).
- **Stock Take Report** — cycle-count lines with expected/counted/variance
  qty and variance value (list + pivot) + printable PDF sheet per session.
- **Spot Check** — new ``spot_check`` sampling method on cycle-count plans
  (small random sample) + dedicated report view filtered on it.
- **Transfer Report** — stock moves by operation type with demand/done qty
  (list + pivot).
- **Scrap Report** — write-offs per bin / SKU / lot with scrap value and the
  replenish flag (list + pivot) + printable Scrap Note PDF.

All analysis models are read-only SQL views. Each one also exports to
**XLSX with embedded Code128 barcodes** — one column for the transaction
(picking / scrap order / count session / bin) and one for the line item
(lot when tracked, else the product EAN) — so the sheet stays scannable
outside Odoo. The PDFs carry the same two barcode levels.
