WMS Handheld (HHT) Application
==============================
Replaces the generic ``custom_hht_bridge`` demo shell (5 tabs, empty stubs, a
scan endpoint that only *logged* the scan) with a task-driven warehouse app
that actually moves stock through the WMS modules:

- **Sidebar shell** with a work-queue badge per module instead of flat tabs.
- **Receive** — open receipts, GS1/EAN scan, IMEI serial capture, expiry +
  supplier batch, QC pass/fail on the quarantine gate.
- **Putaway** — the engine's ranked bin suggestion per line, accept or
  override by scanning a bin.
- **Pick & Pack** — pick list grouped by source bin, scan-to-confirm, put in
  package, validate.
- **Package** — scan any package to see its contents, location and history;
  move it bin-to-bin.
- **Count** — cycle-count / spot-check sessions line by line.
- **Bin-to-bin** — transfer-order proposals raised by the low-water engine.
- **Stock check** — scan a product to see its details, the put-away
  engine's suggested bin, and on-hand/reserved stock per bin. Read-only.

Deliberately a separate module from ``custom_hht_bridge``: the bridge is
installed on ARKA production databases that have none of the ``custom_wms_*``
models, and it must not be forced to upgrade for a WMS-only feature.
