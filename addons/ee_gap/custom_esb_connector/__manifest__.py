Custom ESB Connector
====================

The Odoo side of the ESB edge. ESB Core remains the **source of truth for stock**;
this module mirrors ESB master data and balances into Odoo and pushes documents
back as native ESB records. It contains no business logic — forecasting, counting
and replenishment live in the consuming vertical module.

- Registers ``esb_core`` / ``esb_corev1`` / ``esb_oms`` adapters on top of
  ``custom_adapter_framework`` (retry, circuit breaker, append-only call log).
  ESB serves three different hosts, hence three ``custom.adapter.config`` rows.
- ``custom.esb.session`` manages the 1-hour JWT access token and 24-hour refresh
  token behind a row lock, because ESB evicts any existing session on login.
  A static API key issued by the ESB PIC is supported and preferred.
- Unwraps the ESB response envelope: ``HTTP 200`` with ``status: "fail"`` is a
  failure, and envelope errors are mapped to non-retryable status codes.
- Mirrors branches, locations, units, purposes, document templates, products and
  product details, keyed by ESB IDs for idempotent upsert.
- ``custom.esb.stock.snapshot`` derives on-hand balances from the stock-movement
  report, because ESB exposes no bulk stock-on-hand endpoint.
- ``custom.esb.outbox`` is the single outbound path (item journal, purchase
  request, goods transfer request, purchase order), pushed asynchronously via
  ``queue_job``. ESB has no idempotency header, so the outbox stamps a key into
  ``additionalInfo`` and checks the Index endpoint before creating.

Everything degrades gracefully: with no active ``custom.adapter.config`` the
crons no-op and pushes stay queued, so the module is installable long before ESB
credentials exist. All outbound writes are additionally gated behind the
``esb.push_enabled`` system parameter, which defaults to off.

See ``docs/integrations/esb-core-api.md`` for the API reference.
