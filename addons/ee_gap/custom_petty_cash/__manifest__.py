Custom Petty Cash — Uang Muka Operasional
==========================================

A full petty-cash cycle for Finance and employees on Odoo 19 Community:

1. **Pengajuan** — an employee requests petty cash for an Operating Unit
   (``petty.cash.request``), optionally broken down into estimate lines.
2. **Review & Approval** — Finance reviews; approval routes through the
   generic ``custom_approval_engine`` matrix (multi-tier, delegation, SLA).
3. **Pencairan (Bank Out)** — Finance disburses the approved amount, booking
   *Dr Uang Muka Petty Cash (employee) / Cr Bank* through the Bank-Out journal.
4. **Realisasi** — the employee accounts for the spend
   (``petty.cash.realization``):
     * *Pihak ketiga* lines create a full vendor bill (billing → PPN/PPh via
       ``custom_tax_id`` → invoicing → payment against the advance → COA),
       and require the supplier invoice attachment.
     * *Expense* lines post a direct entry *Dr Expense / Cr Uang Muka*.
5. **Pengembalian / Top-up** — leftover cash is returned to the bank, or a
   shortfall is topped up, until the employee advance nets to zero and the
   request is settled (advance lines auto-reconciled).
6. **Monitoring** — kanban/list dashboards by state, a per-employee
   **Outstanding** ledger and an **Aging** report, both reusing the
   ``custom_accounting_reports`` engine (PDF / XLSX / on-screen table).

Operating-Unit aware: when the Levi's localization is installed the OU
analytic is stamped onto every generated journal item; otherwise the module
runs unchanged.
