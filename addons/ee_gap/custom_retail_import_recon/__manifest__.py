Retail Import — X-Store Reconciliation
--
Finance's question after every nightly import is the same: *did everything the
stores rang up actually land in Odoo, and if not, why not?* Answering it used to
mean exporting the POS list, exporting the X-Store file, and diffing them in a
spreadsheet.

This report answers it on screen. One row per source transaction, straight from
the staged X24DN rows, showing:

* the transaction header - store, trading day, register, receipt number, cashier
  and member, so a row can be traced back to a physical receipt;
* what the file said - line count, quantity, gross amount and tax;
* what Odoo booked - the POS order and its total;
* the difference, and a status saying whether it was **posted**, **parked**
  (rejected, with the importer's own reason), or **not found**.

Separate module on purpose. It joins ``pos_order``, so it depends on
``point_of_sale`` - and ``trn_arkaaim`` runs ``custom_retail_import`` without POS.
Folding this into the shared addon would force a POS install on that tenant.
