Custom Finance Budget
=====================

Read-only cost budget reference (per division / cost-center / period) synced
from SAP by ``custom_finance_portal_sap``. Provides ``_check_document_budget``,
called by ``finance.document.mixin`` on submission to block a Finance Portal
document whose amount would exceed the remaining budget for its division.

Enforcement is soft: when no matching budget row exists (budget not yet loaded
for that division/year) the check passes, so the portal stays usable before the
SAP budget feed is live. Toggle hard blocking with the
``custom_finance_budget.enforce`` config parameter (default ``1``).
