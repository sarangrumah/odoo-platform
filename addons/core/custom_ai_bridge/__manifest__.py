Bridge between Odoo and the platform AI gateway service.

Features:
- ``custom.ai`` service: ``chat()``, ``recommend(model, res_id, payload)`` calls
  the gateway with HMAC signing.
- Settings UI under Custom Platform > AI Intelligence for provider override,
  default model, quality tier, per-model on/off.
- "Ask AI" wizard that can be invoked on any record to get a structured
  recommendation from the gateway.

Depends on `custom_core` for HMAC helper and encrypted config storage.
