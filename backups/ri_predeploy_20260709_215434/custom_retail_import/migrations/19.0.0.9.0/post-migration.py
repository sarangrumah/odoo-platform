"""Bring existing databases in line with the 19.0.0.9.0 data files.

``data/feeds.xml`` and ``data/cron.xml`` are ``noupdate="1"``, so editing them only
affects fresh installs. Everything an existing tenant needs is applied here instead.

Deliberately NOT touched:

* ``retail.import.mailbox.active`` / ``purge_enabled`` / ``dry_run`` — mail fetching and
  message deletion stay off until an admin turns them on in exactly one database (the
  cron runs per-database, and two databases polling the same INBOX would race to delete
  each other's messages).
* ``cron_poll_retail_feeds.active`` — on a tenant with ``retail_import.x24_post_enabled``,
  enabling it starts posting POS orders and journal entries automatically. That is an
  operator decision, not something a schema upgrade should make.
